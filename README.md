# Westeros Interactive Map

## What will the application do?

This project will be an interactive map of Westeros, inspired by the "Game of Thrones" series. The application will allow users to:

- Explore key locations, and events within the world of Westeros.
- Click on different locations to access detailed information, including descriptions, images, and historical context.
- Zoom in and out of regions and navigate between various areas of the map.
- Filter locations based on criteria such as alliances, important battles, or cities.
- Display statistical features on interaction with landmarks / cities in the map.
  
## Who will use it?

The primary users of this application will be:

- Fans of the "Game of Thrones" series and "A Song of Ice and Fire" books.
- Individuals who want to explore the geographical and historical details of Westeros.

## Why is this project of interest to you?

This project is of particular interest to me because:

- I am passionate about both the technical aspects of programming and the world-building within the "Game of Thrones" universe.
- I want to combine my love for storytelling and software development, creating a tool that allows users to dive deeper into the lore of Westeros.

## Phase 4: Task 3

Upon reviewing the design presented in my UML class diagram, I noticed that my program has a high degree of coupling, with many related connections, particularly when passing data between model classes. The diagram is very complex, making the relationships somewhat messy. This could lead to maintainability issues, as modifying one part of the application might require changes across multiple related classes, increasing the risk of unintended consequences.

If I had more time, I would restructure how data flows between different parts of the application to make the design more modular. Instead of having direct dependencies between many classes, I would introduce a way to package and pass data in a more organized manner, reducing the number of direct connections and thus making the diagram easier. Additionally, I would create a central point of control for managing interactions between related components (like accessing Visit/City/LocationManager), making it easier to update or extend the system without affecting multiple areas at once. These changes would improve maintainability, reduce unintended side effects, and make future modifications smoother.
