# Westeros Interactive Map

## What will the application do?

This project will be an interactive map of Westeros, inspired by the "Game of Thrones" series. The application will allow users to:

- Explore key locations, and events within the world of Westeros.
- Click on different locations to access detailed information, including descriptions, images, and historical context.
- Zoom in and out of regions and navigate between various areas of the map.
- Filter locations based on criteria such as alliances, important battles, or cities.
- Display statistical features on interaction with landmarks / cities in the map.
  
## Who will use it?

The primary users of this application will be:

- Fans of the "Game of Thrones" series and "A Song of Ice and Fire" books.
- Individuals who want to explore the geographical and historical details of Westeros.

## Why is this project of interest to you?

This project is of particular interest to me because:

- I am passionate about both the technical aspects of programming and the world-building within the "Game of Thrones" universe.
- I want to combine my love for storytelling and software development, creating a tool that allows users to dive deeper into the lore of Westeros.
